The given C++ program is a robust and instructive implementation of a mathematical expression evaluator that leverages core programming concepts such as stack-based parsing, operator precedence handling, exception management, and dynamic input processing. The primary functionality of the code is to accept a user-defined arithmetic expression from the command line, parse the expression accurately considering parentheses and operator precedence, and compute the final result while gracefully handling any runtime errors, such as division by zero. This entire functionality is achieved using standard C++ libraries, which ensures that the program is portable, efficient, and compliant with ISO C++ standards. The tools used in this code include fundamental header files like `<iostream>`, which handles input and output operations; `<stack>`, which provides the stack data structure essential for parsing expressions in accordance with operator precedence rules; `<cctype>`, which includes useful functions such as `isdigit()` and `isspace()` for checking character types; and `<stdexcept>`, which enables runtime error handling through exception mechanisms like `throw` and `catch`. Although `<sstream>` and `<map>` are included, they are not directly used in the current version, but they suggest a future scope for expanding the program with features like variable handling or tokenization. The logic involves reading characters from the input string and categorizing them as either numeric values, operators, or parentheses. Numbers are read completely, converted to doubles using `stod()`, and pushed onto the value stack. Operators are managed through a separate stack which ensures that operations are executed in the correct order by comparing operator precedence and processing accordingly. Parentheses are handled by temporarily overriding operator precedence, ensuring that expressions within brackets are computed before being integrated into the larger expression. Once all characters are processed, any remaining operators are resolved, and the final result is obtained from the values stack. This code was developed using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, a lightweight yet powerful source code editor developed by Microsoft. VS Code offers comprehensive support for C++ development through extensions like the Microsoft C/C++ extension, which provides IntelliSense, code navigation, and debugging capabilities. It integrates well with compilers such as GCC or MinGW and supports direct terminal usage for compiling and executing code. This makes it particularly suitable for developing, testing, and debugging command-line applications such as this expression evaluator. The applicability of this program is extensive. It is especially useful in educational contexts for demonstrating how infix expression evaluation works and for understanding the practical use of stacks and operator precedence. It also lays a foundational understanding for building more complex software such as interpreters, compilers, and GUI-based calculator applications. In systems with limited user interfaces, such as embedded systems, similar logic can be used for processing arithmetic expressions in configuration scripts or input fields. Furthermore, the logic is commonly used in competitive programming and technical interviews where expression parsing problems are frequently encountered. The codeâ€™s structure is modular and easy to extend, allowing for future enhancements such as support for variables, functions, exponentiation, or graphical front-ends. In conclusion, this expression evaluator in C++ is a powerful educational and practical tool, developed using industry-standard tools and best practices, and its execution within Visual Studio Code ensures a smooth and professional development experience.
